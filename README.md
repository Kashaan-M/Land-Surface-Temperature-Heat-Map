# Heat Map of Global Land Surface Temperatures

#### between (January 1753 - September 2015)

This data visualization was created using [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3)

Since the dataset involved discreet data involving "variance", **scaleBand()** was used

**legend** was created using **scaleThreshold()** because this scale (from [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale)) gives results similar to _Math.round()_

This project was created for the [Data Visualization Certification - freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects)
